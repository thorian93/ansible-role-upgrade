## Features

- Reboot detection and automatic reboot
- Service restart detection and automatic service restarts
- Upgrade reporting
  - via Mail
  - via Telegram

## Here be Dragons!

The reboot and service restart checks for APT are implemented via [needrestart](https://github.com/liske/needrestart). For Fedora this is implemented through the dnf plugin [needs-restarting](https://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/needs_restarting.html).
For RHEL/CentOS it is implemented through the [needs-restarting](https://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/needs_restarting.html) tool.

The role uses the output or return codes respectively to decide what actions to take. You can configure the behavior through the variables below.

Neither of these methods are perfect but it works reasonably good. You might want to look through the role before using it though.

## Known issues

- Debian 11: Without setting `ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3` explicitly, the `apt` module will try to install `python-apt` on the fly, which fails. See [this issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69053) for more details.
- CentOS 8: Reboot detection does not work as there is a flag missing for the dnf needs-restarting plugin. No reboot will be performed at any time.
- Fedora 32 and earlier: Service restart detection does not work as there is a flag missing for the dnf needs-restarting plugin. No service restarts will be performed at any time.
- **opensuse 15 and 42**: A missing dependency does not allow installation of a dependent tool. A workaround is in place. Also the upgrade process seems unstable. I will list these distributions as stable regarding below mentioned OS compatibility check anyway as currently the role does not seem to break stuff, but please be careful! Also feel free to give me a hint, if you know how to fix this stuff.
- **opensuse 15 and 42**: The service restart detection uses a 'brute force' approach, as the output of `zypper ps -s` is a pain in the bum to parse. So for now these OS will simply reboot if any services need to be restarted.

## Requirements

When using the reporting via Telegram feature: 

    collections:
    - name: community.general
      version: 3.4.0

Note that this role requires root access, so either run it in a playbook with a global `become: yes`, or invoke the role in your playbook like:

    - hosts: foobar
      roles:
        - role: thorian93.upgrade
          become: yes

Also this role only **checks if the system is available at port 22** after a reboot. If you need further checks or validation you need to take care of that yourself.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):


### Basic Variables

    upgrade_packages_on_hold: []

Set packages which you don't want to upgrade automatically on hold before upgrading.

    upgrade_unattended_reboot: 'true'

Enable unattended reboot in case it is necessary after updates. Default is `true`, set to `false` to disable reboots.

    upgrade_force_reboot: 'false'

Force a reboot of each server independent of the result of the reboot check. Default is `false`, set to `true` to enable forced reboots.

    upgrade_needrestart_disable_interaction: 'true'

The `needrestart` tool is used to determine necessary reboots and service restarts. Some distributions configure it to run interactively by default, which breaks this role. Therefore the default setting is to disable all interaction. Set this to `false` to keep interaction enabled. See the manpage for further details.

    upgrade_restart_services: 'true'

Enable automatic service restarts. This causes the role to restart services which need restarting. Default is `true`, set to `false` to disable reboots.

    upgrade_restart_services_blacklist:
      - auditd.service
      - dbus.service
      - systemd-manager.service

Blacklist services that should not or cannot be restarted. The default list ist based on and expanded per experience. Feel free to report services that need to be added here.

### Reporting Variables

    upgrade_reporting_enable: 'false'

Enable the reporting function of this role to output the installed updates and optionally write them to file.

    upgrade_reporting_path: "."

Define where the reports should be placed. Default is your current working directory.

    upgrade_reporting_cleanup: 'true'

Clean up the report files used to send reports. Might be useful for debugging to keep them.

### Telegram Reporting Variables

    upgrade_reporting_telegram_enable: 'false'

Enable reporting via Telegram. **You need to configure the following two variables with your credentials to actually send messages via Telegram!** See [the module documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/telegram_module.html) for details.

    upgrade_telegram_token:  []

Your Telegram Bot Token.

    upgrade_telegram_chatid: []

Your Telegram Chat ID.

### Mail Reporting Variables

    upgrade_reporting_mail_enable: 'false'

Enable reporting via Mail.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_subject: "Ansible Update Role Reporting"

Configure the subject of the mail.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_to: []

Define the recipient(s) of the mail.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_from: []

Define the sender of the mail.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_host: []

Define the mail server or relay.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_port: []

Define the mail server port.

    upgrade_reporting_mail_user:
    upgrade_reporting_mail_password:

If the mail server needs authentication, set a username and password here. **If no authentication is required, make sure to leave the variables blank as seen here! Do not make it empty as seen above.**


    upgrade_reporting_mail_run_once: 'true'

If you want to send one email per play set this to true. If you rather send one mail per host set it to `false`.

## Dependencies

None.

## OS Compatibility

This role ensures that it is not used against unsupported or untested operating systems by checking, if the right distribution name and major version number are present in a dedicated variable named like `<role-name>_stable_os`. You can find the variable in the role's default variable file at `defaults/main.yml`:

    role_stable_os:
      - Debian 10
      - Ubuntu 18
      - CentOS 7
      - Fedora 30

If the combination of distribution and major version number do not match the target system, the role will fail. To allow the role to work add the distribution name and major version name to that variable and you are good to go. But please test the new combination first!

Kudos to [HarryHarcourt](https://github.com/HarryHarcourt) for this idea!
